### Howdy

I'm Noah! My pronouns are he/him and I'm a software engineer who love all things
backend/SRE/Ops. I work for Gravitational, building Teleport. I write Go day-to-day, but I'm also comfortable with Typescript and Python. At a stretch, I can work with C, C++ and Rust.

I have a blog (that I sometimes update) at https://noahstride.co.uk.

FOSS is awesome, and I've made a few contributions here and there. Here are
projects I'm a maintainer of:

- https://github.com/zmb3/spotify
- https://github.com/strideynet/bsky-furry-feed

See https://github.com/strideynet.keys for my SSH keys. I use these for signing
too!
