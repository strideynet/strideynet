### Howdy!

I'm Noah! My pronouns are he/him and I'm a software engineer who love all things Ops/Backend. I work for Cudo Ventures as a senior software engineer, and I specialise in ops. Golang and Typescript are my day-to-day languages, but I've used everything from C# to PHP!

I have a blog (that I sometimes update) at https://noahstride.co.uk.

FOSS is awesome, and I've made a few contributions here and there. Here are projects I'm a maintainer of:
