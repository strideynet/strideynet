### Howdy!

I'm Noah! My pronouns are he/him and I'm a software engineer who love all things Ops/Backend. I work for Cudo Ventures as a senior software engineer, and I specialise in ops. Golang and Typescript are my day-to-day languages, but I've used everything from C# to PHP!

I have a blog (that I sometimes update) at https://noahstride.co.uk.

In 2021, I'm looking to get more involved with FOSS ops projects like Prometheus, Istio and Kubernetes, so keep an eye on my contributions :)

Projects I have contributed to:
- [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-community/prometheus/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Astrideynet+])
- [Prometheus Helm Chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-chart/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Astrideynet+])
